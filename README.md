# VHDL Binary Teacher
A game for Xlinix boards. In order to play the game, upload the generated bitsream onto your board.

The game automatically begins upon power up. The screen will display a number in base 10. Your goal is to use the switches on the board to enter that number in binary. Once your input matches what is on the screen, the screen will show a new number. During this, the LEDs are lighting up. Once the last LED lights up, your time is up, and your score will display on the screen. This is the end of the game. Good luck and try to beat your high score!

Note: The max score on the game is 16. If you pass this score the game will not spit out any more numbers. 

This code was written in VHDL for the CPE 133 class at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with Professor Gary Perks for my final assignment. The idea and code is my own, unless otherwise noted at the top of the file.
